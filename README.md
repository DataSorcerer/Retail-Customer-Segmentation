# Online Retail store: Customer Segmentation

[Check out the detailed report and source code](https://github.com/DataSorcerer/Retail-Customer-Segmentation/blob/master/Retail_Analytics_report_source_code.ipynb)     

We endeavour to find the various customer segments using the online retail store's transaction data obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Dataset repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail). This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

### The need of customer segmentation:   
The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:    

1. Target Marketing    
2. Client understanding
3. Optimal product placement
4. Searching for new customers
5. Revenue growth   


### Recency-Frequency-Monetary <font color=blue>(RFM) </font> model to determine customer value:    

The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

 - *Recency* – How recently did the customer purchase?
 - *Frequency* – How often do they purchase?
 - *Monetary Value* – How much do they spend?    
 

A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.
